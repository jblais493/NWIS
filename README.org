#title: NWIS Installation Script

The Nowhere Installation Script for Arch based linux distributions

*Nowhere* is a compilation of dotfiles, settings, and programs that aid in minimalist computing utilizing emacs, command line programs, and sensible defaults in a BSPWM Window Management system.  The goal is to reduce latency between input and action, allowing those that wish to create faster and go further with open source and free programs.

Credit to Luke Smith (lukesmith.xyz) for his LARBS script that helped me to create this easy-install script.
